        <p>Our School is both the educational institution and building designed to provide learning spaces 
            and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. 
            Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.
            In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built 
            and operated by both government and private organization. The names for these schools 
            vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include 
            primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed 
            primary education.<br><br>
